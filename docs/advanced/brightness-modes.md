# Brightness Modes

Enhance your control over brightness transitions during sunrise and sunset with the `brightness_mode` option.

## Available Modes

Adaptive Lighting supports three brightness modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Standard behavior based on sun position |
| `linear` | Linear ramp between min/max brightness |
| `tanh` | Smooth S-curve using hyperbolic tangent |

## Detailed Explanation

With Adaptive Lighting, you can set a `brightness_mode` to specify how the brightness changes during sunrise and sunset. The `brightness_mode` can be set to `"default"` ([as illustrated in other graphs above](#high_brightness-brightness)), `"linear"`, or `"tanh"`. If you choose to deviate from the `"default"` mode, you can adjust `brightness_mode_time_dark` and `brightness_mode_time_light` to further customize the lighting transitions.

When `brightness_mode` is set to `"linear"`:

- During **_sunset_**, the brightness begins to gradually decrease from `max_brightness` starting at `time=sunset_time - brightness_mode_time_light`, until it reaches `min_brightness` at `time=sunset_time + brightness_mode_time_dark`.
- During **_sunrise_**, the brightness begins to gradually increase from `min_brightness` starting at `time=sunrise_time - brightness_mode_time_dark`, until it reaches `max_brightness` at `time=sunrise_time + brightness_mode_time_light`.

When `brightness_mode` is set to `"tanh"`, it uses the smooth transition of a [hyperbolic tangent function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicTangent.html):

- During **_sunset_**, the brightness starts to decrease from 95% of `max_brightness` starting at `time=sunset_time - brightness_mode_time_light`, until it reaches 5% of `min_brightness` at `time=sunset_time + brightness_mode_time_dark`.
- During **_sunrise_**, the brightness starts to increase from 5% of `min_brightness` starting at `time=sunrise_time - brightness_mode_time_dark`, until it reaches 95% of `max_brightness` at `time=sunrise_time + brightness_mode_time_light`.

## Configuration Parameters

When using `linear` or `tanh` modes, you can fine-tune the transition with these parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `brightness_mode_time_dark` | 900 (15 min) | Duration to ramp brightness before/after sunrise/sunset |
| `brightness_mode_time_light` | 3600 (1 hour) | Duration to ramp brightness after/before sunrise/sunset |

## Example Configurations

### Quick Transition (Linear)

```yaml
adaptive_lighting:
  - name: "Quick transitions"
    lights:
      - light.living_room
    brightness_mode: linear
    brightness_mode_time_dark: 600    # 10 minutes
    brightness_mode_time_light: 1800  # 30 minutes
```

### Smooth Transition (Tanh)

```yaml
adaptive_lighting:
  - name: "Smooth transitions"
    lights:
      - light.bedroom
    brightness_mode: tanh
    brightness_mode_time_dark: 1200   # 20 minutes
    brightness_mode_time_light: 3600  # 1 hour
```

## Graphs

These graphs show how brightness changes throughout the day based on calculated values:

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'custom_components/adaptive_lighting') -->
<!-- from docs_gen import get_graphs -->
<!-- print(get_graphs()) -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->

These graphs were generated using the values calculated by the Adaptive Lighting sensor/switch(es).

## Interactive Simulator

The best way to understand brightness modes is to experiment with the interactive simulator:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <a href="../simulator/" class="simulator-link">
    Try the Simulator
  </a>
</div>

Adjust the `brightness_mode`, `brightness_mode_time_dark`, and `brightness_mode_time_light` parameters to see how they affect the brightness curve in real-time.
