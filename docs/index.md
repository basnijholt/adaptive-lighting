[Adaptive Lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) is a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that intelligently adjusts the brightness and color of your lights based on the sun's position, while still allowing for manual control.

By automatically adapting the settings of your lights throughout the day, Adaptive Lighting helps maintain your natural circadian rhythm, which can lead to improved sleep, mood, and overall well-being. Experience cooler color temperatures at noon, gradually transitioning to warmer colors at sunset and sunrise.

## Features

When initially turning on a light that is controlled by Adaptive Lighting, the `light.turn_on` service call is intercepted, and the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted based on the sun's position.
After that, the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted at a regular interval.

Adaptive Lighting provides four switches (using "living_room" as an example component name):

- `switch.adaptive_lighting_living_room`: Turn Adaptive Lighting on or off and view current light settings through its attributes.
- `switch.adaptive_lighting_sleep_mode_living_room`: Activate "sleep mode" 😴 and set custom sleep_brightness and sleep_color_temp.
- `switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_brightness_living_room`: Enable or disable brightness adaptation 🔆 for supported lights.
- `switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_color_living_room`: Enable or disable color adaptation 🌈 for supported lights.

## Quick Start

1. **Install via HACS**: Search for "Adaptive Lighting" in the [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. **Add to configuration**: Add `adaptive_lighting:` to your `configuration.yaml`
3. **Configure**: Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → **Adaptive Lighting**
4. **Select your lights**: Choose which lights to control and enjoy automatic adaptation!

```yaml
# Minimal configuration.yaml entry
adaptive_lighting:
  lights:
    - light.living_room
```

> [!TIP]
> **Using the UI exclusively?** Even if you plan to configure everything through the UI, the `adaptive_lighting:` entry must still be present in your `configuration.yaml`.

## How It Works

Adaptive Lighting provides four switches for each configuration (using "living_room" as an example):

| Switch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `switch.adaptive_lighting_living_room` | Main on/off control |
| `switch.adaptive_lighting_sleep_mode_living_room` | Activate sleep mode |
| `switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_brightness_living_room` | Enable/disable brightness adaptation |
| `switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_color_living_room` | Enable/disable color adaptation |
