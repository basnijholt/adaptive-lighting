## Interactive Tools

### Adaptive Lighting Simulator

Visualize how different settings affect your lighting throughout the day:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <a href="../simulator/" class="simulator-link">
    Open the Simulator
  </a>
</div>

The simulator lets you:

- Adjust all configuration parameters in real-time
- See how brightness and color temperature change throughout the day
- Visualize the effects of different `brightness_mode` settings
- Test sleep mode transitions
